pysurges aims to help with the parametric design of CPWG resonator structures, based on [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/).
Each structure is generated by a jupyter notebook, and can be exported to either GDS or DXF files, as well as SVGs for visualisation.

pysurges is still in the early stages of development, things will likely change.

#Installation

pysurges requires [fontforge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) to be installed for text support,
altough this will likely change by including some fonts already converted to shapely polygons.

It is recommended to install pysurges in a virtualenv, in editing mode:

	virtualenv pysurges-testenv
	source pysurges-testenv/bin/activate
	pip install -e .

This will isntall pysurges and all of its dependencies (except fontforge).
Installing this way allows us to modify the code of the installed module.
